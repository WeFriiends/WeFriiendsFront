# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Project Styling and Responsiveness Guide:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kmg58tRs60JY3sIdIc6ey8EG2T7_GVg3PHcSl8J0lZg/edit?usp=sharing

#### createTheme.tsx -

customization MUI styles - default font is Inter, primary color

#### commonStyles.tsx -

file with generic/common app styles (Titles, buttons etc.)

### `Local development`

For convinient development locally was created and set up docker compose file. It's a solution also to avoid CORS error.

#### Important! 
To run the project .env file should be created based on the file .env.sample. Keys ask on the FE slack channel

Repos Web FE and Auth should be located in the same directory, otherwise you need to adapt values `volumes` in docker-compose file accordingly.

`docker-compose up` is command to run the project using docker-compose file.

# Connection to cloud DB

Connection Mongo DB string to use for production purposes
To connect to the cloud database change value of env variable STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING. 
In `docker-compose.yml`:
```
    - STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb+srv://wefriiends-backup:wefriiends2023@cluster0.wir50id.mongodb.net/authorization?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
To run the project use command:
```
docker-compose up
```
